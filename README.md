##COVID Simulation with Repast Simphony

A small ReadMe regarding the code written in the src folder.

The code isn't completed because I can not figure out how to run the builder and the subsequent UI options adding display and everything. I tried but I am not able to.

In the src folder, the java files are:

1. The agent named infected will die based on a probability after getting infected (a few days) and then showing some symptoms.

2. There are Recovered and Dead Agents

3. An infected agent can go to hospital only if they have symptoms.

4. Infected Agents can be safe from virus after they have recovered in the hospital.

5. Infected Agent can die, anywhere becoming a dead agent and no step function is there for them.
